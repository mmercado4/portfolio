**Civil engineer** with 6 years of project management experience. In 2020, I decided to shift my professional career and dive into **software development**. Since then, I have worked with various technologies and agile methodologies that have allowed me to grow rapidly in this field. I am currently working as a **Full Stack developer** with JavaScript, where I combine my analytical skills and prior experience with my passion for programming. I greatly enjoy learning new technologies and tools, as well as building new applications that optimize processes, solve problems, and make a positive impact on people.
